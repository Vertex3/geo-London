Dependencies:
Any map that uses the roads outline feature class may be impacted by a field change.
The integer field Subtype is changing to a string field SType. This may impact symbology in some maps.

Test plan:
Any Map services that use the roads layer should be verified during dev/test timeframe
Testing simple involves opening map documents and verifying that symbols and data sources are not impacted.
